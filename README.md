# freerider-rest-api

**WIP**

REST API that essentially acts as a wrapper around Freeriders public API, allowing filtering queries. 

Filtering queries include searching for rides:

- From point A to point B
- From point A to several points
- From several points to point B



Not intended for commercial use.
