# freerider-rest-api

**WIP**

REST API that essentially acts as a wrapper around Freeriders public API, allowing filtering queries. 

Filtering queries include searching for rides:

- From point A to point B
- From point A to several points
- From several points to point B


Queries: 

origin(s): The starting point(s) of the ride.

destination(s): The destination(s) of the ride.

startDate: The earliest date and time of the ride.

endDate: The latest date and time of the ride.


Not intended for commercial use.
